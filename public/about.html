<h1>About Me</h1>
 <p> Hi there, I’m Bilha. I’ve been an SEO content writer, editor, and strategist for 7+ years. I spend most of my days writing everything from website content, blogs, E-books, social media posts, press releases, and product descriptions- you name it!</p>

 <p>I'm currently taking up classes in Web Developement. My goal is to venture into Cloud Security in the long term. I've never coded before in my life, so I figured taking up a course in web dev will help me familiarize with all the basics of code!</p>
  
  <p> What my typical day looks like- when I’m not writing, doodling ideas, or chatting with my clients, you’ll find me at the gym, reading a book by the nook, or cuddling with my cat Luna.</p>
